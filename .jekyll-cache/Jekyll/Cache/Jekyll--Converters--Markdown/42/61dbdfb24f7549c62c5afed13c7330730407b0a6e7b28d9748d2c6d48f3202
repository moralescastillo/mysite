I"K<p>Often times it is useful to analyze the development of KPIs on a weekly basis. To achieve this, it is necessary to create a column with calendar weeks with some adjustments.</p>

<p>Say you have the table “account calendar” with column <em>Date</em>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>From Data Editor on Power BI Desktop, select the table “calendar table.”</p>

    <p><img src="/asset/screenshot/999-PRE-use-calendar-week-img01.png" alt="" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Create <em>calendar week</em> using each date’s <em>start of week</em> and <em>week number</em>.</p>

    <div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> account calendar =
 SELECTCOLUMNS (
     ADDCOLUMNS (
         ADDCOLUMNS (
             CALENDAR ( MIN ( account[creation date] ), MAX ( account[creation date] ) ),
             "start of week", [Date] - WEEKDAY ( [Date], 3 )
         ),
         "week number", WEEKNUM ( [start of week], 2 )
     ),
     "Date", [Date],
     "calendar week", IF ( [week number] &lt; 10, "CW 0" &amp; [week number], "CW " &amp; [week number] )
 )
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Why use <em>start of week</em> instead of simply using <em>Date</em> to create the calendar week labels? When we use <em>Date</em> as a base for calendar week labels, we run into an issue of compatibility with other columns such as month. Months almost always have 4 weeks plus a couple of days more.  When using <em>start of week</em>, we guarantee that each month has either 4 or 5 weeks. In this way, we prevent visualizations from displaying duplicated data.</p>
