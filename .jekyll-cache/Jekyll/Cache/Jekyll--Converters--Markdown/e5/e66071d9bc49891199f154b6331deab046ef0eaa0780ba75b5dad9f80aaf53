I"€<p>Power BI Desktop is composed of four editors:</p>

<h3 id="power-query">Power Query</h3>

<p>Wirh Power Query Editor, you will extract, transform and load (ETL) your data. The Power Query editor is an add-in of Power BI Desktop which allows users to gather data from different sources such as Excel tables, databases and websites.</p>

<p>The language behind Power Queryâ€™s functions is M (I know, very creative). To access Power Query from Power BI Desktop, select Home &gt; Transform Data.</p>

<h3 id="data">Data</h3>

<p>With Data Editor, the user assigns the final formats to the different columns and tables. Also, the user is able to create new tables and columns, using either pane tools or DAX code. Data resembles Excel tables, both in appearance and in functionality.</p>

<h3 id="model">Model</h3>

<p>With Model Editor, the user creates relations among tables. Modeling data is a crucial aspect, not only within Power BI but also within Business Intelligence as a field. Model gives you the ability to link tables using drag-and-drop tools.</p>
