I"õ<p>I remember the moment I crossed the finish line at the 2019 Berlin Marathon. I began gasping for air and my eyes became watery. Soon after my breathing went back to normal, I realized that I could probably run a bit farther.</p>

<p>But what is farther? A month or so after the marathon, I started researching endurance races nearby.  On a google search, I came across the <a href="https://balatonsupermarathon.runinbudapest.com/13th-lake-balaton-supermarathon/">Balaton Supermarathon</a>. The name caught my attention since I have visited Hungary many times and have fond memories of the country.</p>

<p>The race consists of running around Lake Balaton, the biggest lake in Central Europe. The race breaks down into 4 races, of about 50 km each, distributed over four consecutive days. This race format made the Balaton race a perfect next-step into ultra running.</p>

<p>To prepare for the race, I continued with my marathon training program for about three months. I added mileage to my weekly runs and worked on strength exercises (from the Cool Impossible). About a month before the race, I ran 160 km of the <a href="https://www.komoot.com/tour/78555721">Mauerweg</a>, split over four consecutive days. After this final training push, I did mostly recovery runs until race week.</p>

<p>I flew to Hungary, got to Lake Balaton, and started the race with the wrong foot. On Day 1, I changed my water consumption strategy, to hedge some weight. Wrong move. I ended up mismanaging my water intake throughout the first couple of hours. I bonked at km 32, with 16 km to go. I walked and jog intermittently for the rest of the day. I wanted to puke. I wanted to quit. I made the cut of the day by 120 seconds.  Physically (and mentally!), I was done with the race.</p>
