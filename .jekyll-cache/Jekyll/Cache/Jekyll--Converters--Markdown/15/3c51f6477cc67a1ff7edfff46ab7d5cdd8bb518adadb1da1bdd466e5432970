I"/	<p>When creating a visual, Power BI Desktop uses a default color palette and font. You can customize your visuals by manually changing their color and font.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can import a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/create-reports/desktop-report-themes">Power BI Desktop theme</a>, indicating what color pallet and font to use. You have the option to choose one of the many built-in themes or to customize your own.</p>

<p>Say you have created a report using the default pallet and font:</p>

<p><img src="/asset/screenshot/999-PRE-create-custom-theme-img01.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Now, you would like to customize it by making the report color-blind friendly and use the type font Courier New is all visuals:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Create a report theme by building a JSON file according to your preferences. In our case, the JSON file is readily available <a href="https://community.powerbi.com/t5/Themes-Gallery/Color-Blind-Friendly/m-p/140597">here</a>. We just need to adjust it to include the font type Courier New.</p>

    <div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> { 
     "name": "ColorblindSafe-Longer", 
     "dataColors": ["#074650", "#009292", "#fe6db6", "#feb5da", "#480091", "#b66dff", "#b5dafe", "#6db6ff", "#914800", "#23fd23"],
     "background":"#FFFFFF",
     "foreground": "#074650",
     "tableAccent": "#fe6db6",
     "visualStyles":{
         "*": {
             "*": {
                 "*":  [{
                         "fontFamily": "Courier New"
                     }]
             }
         }
     }
 }
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Save text above as a JSON file.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From Report Editor, go to <strong>View</strong> &gt; <strong>Themes</strong> &gt; <strong>Browse for themes</strong>.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/asset/screenshot/999-PRE-create-custom-theme-img03.png" alt="" /></p>

<ol>
  <li>Find the JSON file and open it. The theme is then imported and your visuals update with the new theme specifications.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/asset/screenshot/999-PRE-create-custom-theme-img02.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Keep a template .pbix file where the theme JSON file is already uploaded. In this way, you and your colleagues can create new reports with the organizationâ€™s theme right away.</p>
