I"±<p>Once you have created a data mart, and your colleagues have access to it, it will be available as a Power BI dataset.</p>

<p>The problem is, every report that you publish and/or is shared with you will also be available as a Power BI dataset. How do you separate normal reports from data marts?</p>

<p>You can signal to your colleagues (and your future self) that a data mart is ready by promoting it.</p>

<p>To promote a data mart:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>From Power BI Service, go to the Workspace where your data mart is located. Then go to <strong>Datasets + dataflows</strong>.</p>

    <p><img src="/asset/screenshot/promote-data-mart-img01.png" alt="" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Locate the data mart you would like to promote. Go to <strong>More options</strong> &gt; <strong>Settings</strong>.</p>

    <p><img src="/asset/screenshot/promote-data-mart-img02.png" alt="" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click on <strong>Endorsement</strong> and select <strong>Promoted</strong>. Feel free to write a description of your data mart for reference. Click on <strong>Apply</strong>.</p>

    <p><img src="/asset/screenshot/promote-data-mart-img03.png" alt="" /></p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The next time that you connect to the data mart, you will see that it now has the Promoted label.</p>

<p><img src="/asset/screenshot/promote-data-mart-img04.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>In this way, you will distinguish between data marts and other regular datasets.</p>
