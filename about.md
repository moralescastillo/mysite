title: About
---

My name is Paulo and I am a data analyst currently working at [Kapilendo AG](https://www.kapilendo.de/#/). As the lead BI developer and analyst, I am responsible for the companyâ€™s data warehouse development and reporting systems. Before joining Kapilendo, I was a senior data analyst at the credit-comparison site Smava, where I worked for 4 years. 

In terms of technology for data analysis, I am agnostic. Rather, I am a firm believer in best practices. I have professional experience creating products and analysis using R, Python, PowerQuery and SQL (MS SQL Server, PostgreSQL and MySql). In terms of BI development, I have been a user of a wide range of software including Azure products (data factory and databricks), Google Analytics, matomo, Tableau, MS Power Platform (Power BI, Automate, Apps) among others.
