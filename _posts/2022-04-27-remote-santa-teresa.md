### Living and Working
Santa Teresa is frequented by people from all over the world, either chasing waves, admiring the nature, or both. Although very international, I did not meet anybody else working remotely from the area. Here are some thoughts on the whole experience:

* Compared to other countries in Latin America, Costa Rica is expensive. And Santa Teresa, even more.
* WiFi, though widely available, is rather slow and faulty. Specially during storms.
* For being a tropical area, the selection of fruits and vegetables is rather limited. 

### Getting Around
You will often hear that a 4x4 car is a must. The truth is, you do not need a 4x4 car but rather a high car. A high car with a 4x2 traction is not only enough but also cheaper. Alternative ways to get around:

* Quad Bikes
* Motorbikes
* Taxi (if you find one, make sure you take their phone number, for future services)

### Sports

Surf. The waves in the area are some of the biggest I have ever ridden in my short surfer life. Although Santa Teresa Beach is the most frequented surfing spot, I found the waves there to be very challenging for my level. Playa Hermosa, about 5 kilometers north from the center, proved to be a desolated spot with more docile waves to ride. Other sports I saw round town:

* Trail running
* Mountain biking
* There is a functional gym that offers all sort of classes like Muay Thai

Before setting off for Costa Rica, this [post](https://digitalnomads.world/city-guide/santa-teresa/) was a crucial source of information. In conclusion, Santa Teresa is a great place to visit. But I would prefer to be a regular tourist chasing waves than a digital nomad working from the area.
