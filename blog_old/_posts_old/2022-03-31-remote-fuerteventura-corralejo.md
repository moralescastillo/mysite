I had the fortune to spend some time living in and working remotely from Corralejo, Fuerteventura. Here are a couple of tips that may help those on the fence about working remotely from the island.

### Living and Working
Many of Corralejoâ€™s residents are digital nomads themselves. A good way to network is through the [Remote Work Community slack](https://join.slack.com/t/corralejo-rwc/shared_invite/zt-m10w4hpw-W4qGnqVTqhUPjDevA~xgsQ) chat.
Fiber optic internet is widely popular in town. The internet bandwidth in Corralejo was, in my experience, the best I have found while working remotely. If working out of home is more your thing, Uga Uga Cafe or Cofete Coworking are good alternatives. Beware: the coworking spaces in town are rather basic, nothing to compare to coworking places in bigger tech cities. 

### Sports
Anything that has the word "surf" in it. Additionally, the country roads nearby Corralejo are good for road cycling. Northern Fuerteventura is also a good place for trail running. Many rocky hills and volcanos can be found on the outskirts of town.

### Getting Around
Corralejo is a small city. Short distances combined with great weather make it a good place to walk, bike or ride an e-scooter to places. 
Although there are surfing spots in town, they do not work year-round. Most of the surfing spots are situated out of town, for which a rental car would be most convenient. Alternatively, you can arrange transportation to spots out of the city with a local surf school. 

All in all, Corralejo provides you with a good infrastructure and beautiful nature to have a productive and pleasant remote work experience.
