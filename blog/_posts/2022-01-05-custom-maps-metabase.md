One of Metabase's best visualization options is maps. You include a table (dataset) with location-type columns and Metabase would plot the data on a map for you.

When first using the maps feature, I was disappointed to find out that mapping is limited to maps of the US or the whole world. Nothing else. 

Thanks to one of my colleagues, I found out that custom maps are possible in Metabase. The only thing needed is the desired map's GeoJSON file.

For instance, [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moralescastillo/datasets/main/plz-5stellig-berlin.geojson) is the GeoJSON file of Berlin containing coordinates of all of the cityâ€™s zip codes and their names.

To include the GeoJSON file, visit your Metabase instance and click on **Settings** > **Admin** > **Maps** > **Add a map**. Add the raw GeoJSON file as a link, and click on **Load**. Additionally, give the map a name and region identifiers. Click on **Add map**.

After following these steps, your map will be available every time the Map visualization is selected in a new card. [Here](http://pmcinhouse.azurewebsites.net/public/dashboard/b0f68de3-31b2-4cac-b7e8-bb41b8a3adb7) is an example of what the end result would look like in Metabase.
