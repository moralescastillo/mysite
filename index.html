	Welcome
</h1>

<p> 
	Hi and welcome to my site! My name is Paulo Morales Castillo and I am a freelance analytics engineer based in Berlin, Germany. 
</p>

<p> 
	When I am not <a href="/tag/running" target="_blank">running</a> or <a href="tag/remote-work" target="_blank">chasing waves</a>, I am learning about new technologies and tinkering with data in one way or another. I write about my experiences in my <a href="" target="_blank">blog</a>. Keep in mind that, my opinions are my own.

	My work experience

<p> 
	I first entered the world of data analytics in 2014. Back then, I joined a data team of three, me being the second full-time employee at time. Working in a fast-paced environment at a growing startup provided me with the opportunity to dive into different topics across the data realm: Data science, data engineering, web analytics, and marketing analytics to name a few.  
</p>

<p> 
	This setup, combined with my interest in mastering new technologies, eventually led me to become a data all-arounder. Most recently, I have been focusing on tasks that gravitate towards 
	<q cite="https://about.gitlab.com/job-families/finance/analytics-engineer/">
		the intersection of business teams, Data Analytics and Data Engineering.
	</q> 
	Hence the title <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/job-families/finance/analytics-engineer/" target="_blank">analytics engineer</a>.  The most up-to-date version of my resume is available on my <a href="https://github.com/moralescastillo/myresume/blob/a254be7ab4eb8d890c7b068a831995f5010db112/resume_morales_castillo.pdf" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.

<p> 
	My work is concentrated on the following topics:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>descriptive, exploratory, and predictive data analysis 
		(<a href = /tag/python target="_blank">Python</a>, 
		<a href = /tag/r target="_blank">R</a>);
	</li>
	<li>data warehouse setup and maintenance 
		(<a href = /tag/dbt target="_blank">dbt</a>, 
		Azure Synapse, 
		BigQuery);
	</li>
	<li>data orchestration and transformation 
		(<a href = /tag/adf target="_blank">Azure Data Factory</a>, 
		Airflow);
	</li>
	<li>dashboard creation and automation 
		(<a href = /tag/power-bi target="_blank">Power BI</a>, 
		<a href = /tag/metabase target="_blank">Metabase</a>).

	My work style

	An idea for a solution could look great on paper, but often time is not viable in production. Data practitioners out there can relate to such <a href="https://www.wired.com/2012/04/netflix-prize-costs/#:~:text=Netflix%20awarded%20a%20%241%20million,announced%20on%20its%20blog%20Friday." target="_blank">experiences</a>. For this reason, I aim for minimalism over complexity in my solutions. In the context of data, I approach challenges following best practices and keeping the end-audience of my products in mind. 
</p>

<p> 
	I strive to achieve focus on my day-to-day work, wherever and whenever feasible. For this reason, I arrange most of my calls and meetings on Tuesdays, leaving the rest of the week to dedicate all my attention to the tasks at hand.

	What my clients can expect

<p> 
	Reliability in my commitments, transparency in my communication and competence in my work. 
</p>

<p> 
	Moreover, my clients can always expect:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		A calendly link, which they can use to schedule meetings at a time of their convenience.
	</li>
	<li>
		A Trello Kanban board (or any other preferred Kanban technology), where we would frequently communicate about progress, roadblocks and deadlines.
	</li>
	<li>
		A shared folder on Google Drive (or any other prefered cloud storage system), where we would share presentations and documentation.
	</li>
</ul>
